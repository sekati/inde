This file contains important information. Review this information before using this version of INDE.


== What is INDE ==

INDE is an Integrated Development Environment designed to deliver a standardized Eclipse platform that meets the needs of the interactive developer. INDE aims to not only fill the void between Adobe® Flash™ and Flex™ Builder™ but also provided a central platform for other web, RIA and other new media developments (such as PHP, HTML, CSS, XML-XSLT, JavaScript, Java EEE,  SQL and more). It is important to note that INDE is a custom pre-configured Eclipse distribution built using many key open source and commercial plugins (please check the What's Included section below for more details on required commercial licenses).


== What's Included ==

INDE is built using the following Open Source plugins:

  * [http://www.eclipse.org/ Eclipse] - Ganymede SR1
  * [http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn/ Mylyn]
  * [http://subclipse.tigris.org/ Subclipse]
  * [http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/ WTP]
  * [ http://www.eclipse.org/pdt/ PDT]
  * [http://fdt.powerflasher.com/ FDT]

INDE ships with a few peripheral projects to support FDT and Flash™/Flex™ Development:
  * [http://fdtkit.googlecode.com/ FDTKit]
  * [http://sekati.googlecode.com/ Sekati API]
  * [http://sasapi.googlecode.com/ SASAPI]


== Requirements ==

  * MacOS X 10.5 or later.
  * Minimum Processor: >= 1Ghz Intel, G4, G5 recommended.
  * Minimum Memory: >= 2Gb.
  * Mimimum Disk Space: >= 1Gb
  * Java VM >= 1.5.x
  * Flash CS4 (optional)


== Getting Started ==

  # Set your Flash ASO Cache in FDT preferences (`preferences->fdt->Flash->Flash ASO Directory`) e.g: `/Users/jason/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Flash CS4/en/Configuration/Classes/aso`
  # Register your own key for the commercial FDT 3 plugin key (`preferences->fdt->key management`).
  # Launch INDE.app and do an SVN Update (_CNTRL+U_) on _fdtkit, sekati & sasapi_ projects to insure you have the latest utilities and frameworks. Feel free to adjust or add new core libraries as needed.

*Please Note:* INDE _must_ be installed in `/Applications/inde` and your workspace remain `/Applications/inde/workspace` to function properly. If desired you may create an alias to a more convenient location such as your home directory or desktop.


== INDE Project Previewing ==

If you would like to preview your INDE projects in the browser during development you may alter MacOS X's apache httpd.conf to do so (INDE ships with a workspace properly configured for local web hosting), simply follow the steps below:

  # Insure you are currently running Apache by going to `System Preferences -> Sharing` and make sure `Web Sharing` is ticked `On`.
  # Open the `Terminal` application and type: `sudo nano /etc/apache2/httpd.conf`
  # Location the line: `DocumentRoot "/Library/WebServer/Documents"` and change it to: `DocumentRoot "/Applications/inde/workspace"`
  # Locate the line: `<Directory "/Library/WebServer/Documents">` and change it to: `<Directory "/Applications/inde/workspace"> `.
  # Save the configuration file by entering the key combination: `Control + X`, then confirm with `Y`.
  # Enter `sudo apachectl graceful` into your Terminal session to restart apache.
  # Finally open your browser and point it to [http://localhost http://localhost]: you are now able to browse your workspace projects.
