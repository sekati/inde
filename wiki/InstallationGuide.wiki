#INDE2 Installation Guide

= Installation =

Unlike INDE v1, INDE v2 does not include an installer, instead follow the few steps below to install and configure INDE2 for your system.

  # Unzip `inde2.zip` and place it in your `/Applications directory` (e.g. `/Applications/inde2/`).
  # Inside the `inde2` directory you will find a folder named `FDTTemplates`. Copy `FDTTemplates` to: `/Users/your-username/Library/Application Support/`. 
  # Rename `/Users/your-username/Library/Application Support/FDTTemplates`to `/Users/your-username/Library/Application Support/FDT`.
  # Next we will configure your Apache Webserver to point to the *INDE2 workspace*: Open `Terminal.app` & type `sudo /etc/apache2/httpd.conf`.
