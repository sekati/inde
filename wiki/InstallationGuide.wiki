= Installation =

Unlike INDE v1, INDE v2 does not include an installer, instead follow the few steps below to install and configure INDE2 for your system.

  # Unzip `inde2.zip` and place it in your `/Applications directory` (e.g. `/Applications/inde2/`).
  # Inside the `inde2` directory you will find a folder named `FDTTemplates`. Copy `FDTTemplates` to: `/Users/your-username/Library/Application Support/`. 
  # Rename `/Users/your-username/Library/Application Support/FDTTemplates`to `/Users/your-username/Library/Application Support/FDT`.
  # Next we will configure your Apache Webserver to point to the *INDE2 workspace*: Open `Terminal.app` & type `sudo nano /etc/apache2/httpd.conf`.
  # Locate the `DocumentRoot` line in your conf file (e.g. `DocumentRoot "/Library/WebServer/Documents"`).
  # Change this line to read `DocumentRoot "/Applications/inde2/workspace"`.
  # Locate the `Directory` line in your conf file (e.g. `<Directory "/Library/WebServer/Documents">`).
  # Change this line to read `<Directory "/Applications/inde2/workspace">`.
  # Within the `<Directory>` node insure/change the `AllowOverride` to read: `AllowOverride All`.
  # Now locate the line that reads `Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf` - comment this line out by putting a `#` character in front of it (e.g. `#Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf`).
  # FInally, save the httpd.conf file by typing `Control+X`then `Y` to save the file.
  # Lastly, restart apache by typing `sudo apachectl graceful` into`Terminal.app`.
  # Now navigate to `http://localhost/` and you should see your prettified INDE2 workspace:
