INDE is an _Integrated Development Environment_ designed to deliver a standardized Eclipse distribution that meets the needs of the interactive developer/team.

INDE aims to not only fill the void between FlashTM BuilderTM & FDT but also provided a central platform for other mobile, web, RIA and other new media developments (such as PHP, HTML, CSS, XML-XSLT, JavaScript, Java EEE, SQL and more) while focusing on a standardized workspace, streamlining Eclipse's workflow and integrating team version control (SVN/Git).

It is important to note that INDE is a custom pre-configured Eclipse distribution built using many key open source and commercial plugins (please check the [Documentation Wiki's](http://code.google.com/p/inde/wiki/Documentation) _What's Included_ section for more details on required commercial licenses).
